  added to the application's config. The 'xsession.php' goes in your application's libraries.
* Database structure is included in this repo. (see: db.sql) It will be needed to store
  user's and their session data.

operation -
* A POST request is sent to a url that calls  xsession->verify_login()  and the login
  information is evaluated and then produces a session with cookies.
* xsession->gather_user_data()  is called to check and gather the user's session data only
  once the user has logged in and/or has an active session. If the session data provided
  by the client is invalid and/or does not exist, the user will be redirected according to the
  url in the library ('login/error/unauthorised').
  
future updates - 
* A full working app that utilizes a login view, then a range of views to create
  and manage session data. (in development)

functions -
* xsession->verify_login() ==> Process a login; call with form post headers.
* xsession->gather_user_data() ==> Proccess the current user's session.
* xsession->destroy_session() ==> Enough said.

install -
* Database structure is included in this repo. (see: import_to_db.sql) It will be needed 
  to store user's and their session data. Import this into a database
* In '/application/config/config.php', set these variable:
  -  $config['base_url']
  -  $config['encryption_key']
  -  $config['xsession_session_table']
  -  $config['xsession_users_table']
* In '/applcation/config/database.php', set these variables:
  -  $db['default']['hostname'] 
  -  $db['default']['username']
  -  $db['default']['password']
  -  $db['default']['database']
* This app does contain a HTACCESS to create clean URLs (no '/index.php/' in your URL) 
  but may not work on every server. Search the web for info about 'mod_rewrite' on Apache2
  and see if your version of Apache can use it, then continue to search for how to install
  it and enable it on your server. 
  !Otherwise! search along the lines of 'how to remove index.php from codeigniter' and check
  what modification was done to the source and reverse then reverse those modifications on your
  source so index.php is then re-enabled.
  
update CodeIgniter -  
* Download the latest CodeIgniter package from http://codeigniter.com/
  Copy the 'system' folder from within the CodeIgniter package you downloaded, then paste
  it in the 'application' folder in this folder (root).

operation -
* A POST request is sent to a url that calls  xsession->verify_login()  and the login
  information is evaluated and then produces a session with cookies.
* xsession->gather_user_data()  is called to check and gather the user's session data only
  once the user has logged in and/or has an active session. If the session data provided
  by the client is invalid and/or does not exist, the user will be redirected according 
  to the url in the library ('login/error/unauthorised').
  
test -
* Go to 'http://domain/login/' and use 'admin' for both username and password.
